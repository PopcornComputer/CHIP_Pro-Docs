## How much does C.H.I.P. Pro cost?
C.H.I.P. Pro costs $16.

## Are there quantity discounts?
Please contact us: [sales@source.parts](mailto:sales@source.parts). 

## Is the C.H.I.P. Pro open source?
Yes, you can see our design files in our [git repository](https://github.com/NextThingCo/CHIP_Pro-Hardware).

## Does C.H.I.P. Pro replace C.H.I.P.?
C.H.I.P. is still a huge part of what we do. We made C.H.I.P. Pro and Gadget so the enterprising members of the CHIPster community would have a great option for scalable hardware, software and infrastructure for their products.

## Where can I buy the C.H.I.P. Pro?
Currently, we’re offering the C.H.I.P. Pro Dev kit for $49 in our web store with an estimated shipping by the end of this year. C.H.I.P. Pro will be available in Q1 of 2017.

##  How many may I order?
As many or as few as you’d like. 1 to 1 million (or more). For larger orders, hit us up at [sales@source.parts](mailto:sales@source.parts)

## When will C.H.I.P. Pro ship?
C.H.I.P. Pro Dev kits are shipping in late Q4 of 2016 and C.H.I.P. Pro will be available in any quantity starting Q1 of 2017.

##  What is the lead time on a C.H.I.P. Pro order?
Once available in Q1 of 2017, small orders (1-20) will ship immediately. For large orders taking advantage of our factory flashing offering, there will be a lead time of 60 days.

##  I made a C.H.I.P. prototype, will it be hardware and software compatible with GR8?
Yes! GR8 has the same Allwinner R8 processor that is in C.H.I.P., so your C.H.I.P. software is 100% compatible with C.H.I.P. Pro. We believe you shouldn’t have to change your software to go into production.
